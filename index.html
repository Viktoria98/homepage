                          asset management entrepreneurship, and wealth creation. 98% students gave positive 
                          reviews while studying, however some of these ungrateful gringos filed lawsuits 
                          against Trump University after the course. I had to pay $25 million to settle that...

                          (and there is another annual fee for members, it is very expensive to be rich). 
                          That year I also opened a casino called Trump Castle. My wife Ivana became 
                          a manager, because she is another Trump!

                          a crew of undocumented Polish workers to demolish the historic Bonwit 
                          Teller store, including art deco features. All this to make architectural 
                          critic Paul Goldberger say in 1983 that the tower's atrium is "the most pleasant 
                          interior public space to be completed in New York in some years". At the same 
                          time I also started a repair job on the Wollman Rink in Central Park and 
                          completed the work in three months for $1.95 million, which was $775,000 less
